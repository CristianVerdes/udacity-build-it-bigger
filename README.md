# Build it bigger - Forth project form the Android Developer Nanodegree program

# NOTES
- Created a Java library that provides jokes.
- Created an Android Library containing an Activity that will display a joke
passed to it as an intent extra
- Instead of pulling jokes directly from our Java library, we'll set up a Google Cloud Endpoints development server.

# What Will I Learn?

You will learn the role of Gradle in building Android Apps and how to use
Gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity. You'll learn to:

* Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them
* Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
* Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
